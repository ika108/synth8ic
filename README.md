========

Collaborative project to build a full featured 8 bit synthetiser
(May include a game cabinet control surface one day...)

This project is mainly leaded by myself (Sven) and our lead dev is Youenn.
Everybody willing to help while respecting our chart (which is to be define) is of course welcome.

Thanks.

Sven
